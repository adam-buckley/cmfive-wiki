[[title|Standard Wiki Shortcodes and Macros]]

<h2>Shortcodes</h2>
Wiki shortcodes are evaluated just prior to the wiki page being rendered on the screen. 
Therefore shortcodes always get replaced by HTML code.

Any cmfive module can implement custom shortcodes, however the following standard
Wiki shortcodes are always available:

<h3>Linking to a Wiki Page</h3>
When linking to a wiki page, it doesn't matter whether that page actually exists or not.
In fact linking to a non-existing wiki page is the <b>only</b> way in which new pages can be
created in the wiki. 

<pre>
[[page|ThisIsANewPage(|Optional Page Titel)]]
</pre>

The page title is optional, but it helps with readability.

<h3>Linking to a URL</h3>
<p>Although both markdown and richtext have facilities to make this simpler, this
shortcode adds a consistent way to link to other webpages. It also has the
advantage that the link title is optional.</p>

<pre>
[[link|http://www.this-is-a-url.com(|Optional Link Titel)]]
</pre>

<h3>Embedding video content</h3>
<p>Currently only youtube and vimeo hosted videos are supported. The shortcode
only expects the <b>id</b> of the video. So if the youtube link is</p>

<pre>
https://youtu.be/g_cpVyZ_ZSY
</pre>

<p>then the <b>id</b> is <b>g_cpVyZ_ZSY</b>.</p>

<p>To embed this video, use the following shortcode:</p>

<pre>
[[ video|youtube|g_cpVyZ_ZSY|A great video]]
</pre>

<p>The full definition of the shortcode is:</p>
<pre>
[[ video|{vimeo/youtube/local}|{id/filename}|{title}(|{width}|{height})]]
</pre>

<p>The width and height parameters are optional.</p>

<h2>Macros</h2>
<p>Macros are like shortcodes in that they get replaced with something else. However macros are getting
replaced just prior to the wiki page being <b>saved</b> in the database. This means that macros get replaced
with either markdown or html (depending on the type of wiki) or even with shortcodes!</p>

<h3>Inject the current date and time</h3>
<p>The following macro will resolve into the current data and time.</p>
<pre>
@@timestamp@@
</pre>

<h3>Inject the current user's name and current date and time</h3>
<p>When using a wiki page for discussion it is useful to timestamp a written section and state one's name. 
The following macro makes this easy. It gets replaced with your full name and the current date and time.</p>
<pre>
@@userstamp@@
</pre>
